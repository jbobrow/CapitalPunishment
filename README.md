Stats on executions in the US from 2010 - 2015 parsed from http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/

Using Kimono's quick API tool, each json file was created like so...
curl -K --include --request GET "https://www.kimonolabs.com/api/ondemand/ekm25qni?apikey=##############&kimpath1=execution-list-2015" >> 2015.json

The article that sparked my curiosity:
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/us/victims-in-boston-marathon-bombings-are-split-on-death-penalty.html

The stats that upset me:
http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdfs/DeathPenaltyFactsMay2012.pdf
"The death penalty is racially biased. Since 1977, the overwhelming majoirty of death row defendants(77%) have been executed fro killing white victims, even though African-Americans make up about half of all homicide victims."
